    <h1>How to Make Homemade Lasagna</h1>
    <p> Making homemade lasagna much easier than it looks. You'll find the full,
        step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly.
            Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned
            tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt,
            oregano, and sugar.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
        <li> Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley,
            the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li> Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce
            and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
        <li> Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour.
            Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1> How Long to Cook Lasagna </h1>
    <p> In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be perfectly baked in about
        50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes uncovered).</p>
    <h1>How to Store and Freeze Lasagna</h1>
    <p> Allow the homemade lasagna to cool completely, then transfer the leftovers to an airtight container.
        Store in the refrigerator for up to four days. Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.
    </p>
    <p>If you plan to freeze lasagna, it's best to bake it in a foil pan. Allow it to cool completely,
        then tightly wrap the entire dish in storage wrap. Next, wrap it in at least one tight layer
        of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat
        in the oven or microwave.
